Introduction
============

Welcome to Picasso.

Please open and run the project in IntelliJ.

Upon execution, you should be greeted with the help menu and a command prompt.

Enter D to see the demo as per the requirements document.
Enter A to see another demo demonstrating a little more functionality.

Enter ? at anytime to see a list of available commands.

Architecture
============

The application architecture is flexible, it uses Spring Context.

Components
----------
Components are the building blocks of the application.

* Main: 			initializes the Context, bootstraps the Application
* Application:  	gets input (InputProcessor) runs commands (CommandManager)
* InputProcessor: 	converts user input into an Input object
* CommandManager: 	identifies commands and executes them
* Renderer: 		outputs to the console
* Canvas:  			the drawing surface
* ContextProvider   makes the context available to other classes

Graphics
--------
Graphics primitives draw upon the Canvas.

* Fill              performs a bucket fill
* Line              draws a line
* Plot              plots a point
* Rectangle         draws a rectangle
* Text              writes text
* Triangle          draws a triangle

Commands
--------
Commands use the primitives to perform user actions (Input).

Each command is registered as a bean, its name matching the user command.

* Command           base of all commands, abstract class
* ...               a number of commands implementing specific behavior

Tests
-----
There are a few tests to verify core functionality.
