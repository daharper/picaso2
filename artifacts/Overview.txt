Introduction
============

Welcome to Picasso.

Please open and run the project in IntelliJ.

Upon execution, you should be greeted with the help menu and a command prompt.

Enter D to see the demo as per the requirements document.
Enter A to see another demo demonstrating a little more functionality.

Enter ? at anytime to see a list of available commands.

Architecture
============

The application architecture is flexible, it uses a Spring Context. It is easy to add
new functionality, and simple to expand the command manager to support persistence.

* Main   			executes commands until the user quits
* ProjectConfig     configures the Spring Context

Core
----
Core components of the application.

* Input             represents the user input, contains utility accessor methods
* InputProcessor 	converts user input into an Input object
* Command           base abstraction for all commands
* CommandManager  	identifies commands and executes them
* Renderer  		outputs to the console
* Canvas   			the drawing surface
* CanvasException   contains an error identified by the Canvas

Graphics
--------
Graphics primitives draw upon the Canvas.

* Fill              performs a bucket fill
* Line              draws a line
* Plot              plots a point
* Rectangle         draws a rectangle
* Text              writes text
* Triangle          draws a triangle

Commands
--------
Commands use the primitives to perform user actions (Input).

Tests
-----
There are a few tests to verify core functionality.
